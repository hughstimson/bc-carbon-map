# Interactive BC Carbon Map

This carbon mapping and accounting application was commissioned in 2012 by the Tyee Solutions Society, and originally 
hosted there and described in a series of articles on The Tyee website, including this one:

[https://thetyee.ca/News/2012/07/04/CarbonFootprint/](https://thetyee.ca/News/2012/07/04/CarbonFootprint/)

Data sources and methodology are described in the application interface, and in the articles linked above. 

The application stopped functioning when Google Fusion Tables was deprecated in 2019.

A mostly-non-functioning view of the application is present in the Wayback Machine archive here:
